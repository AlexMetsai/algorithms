# algorithms

After some time writing code professionaly, I thought that it would be interesting to take a step back and look at algorithms from a more theoretical perspective, revisiting subjects such as time complexity analysis, data structures, and the study of fundamental algortihms in general. This repository is kind of a parallel effect to this where I implement various algortihms that I'm currently looking into. Usually reading is not sufficient; you have to get your hands dirty (in my humble opinion at least).

The scope is to keep the implementation as simple, readable, and clean as possible, focusing on each algorithm and not on language, syntax or any boilerplate code (python is great for this). One small deviation from this is the inclusion of type hints. These are introduced specifically to improve readability and help in following the logic.
